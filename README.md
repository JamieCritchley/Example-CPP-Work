# Example-CPP-Work
An example of my C++ work, following essential OOP principles. The code creates various different movable shapes on a graph.

All work is my own except for the basics of the driver code, which was provided already. To view this starting driver code, see the "Driver Original" file.
While the code has its own explanation of how to use it, I have attatched a sheet of example inputs and expected outputs, as provided by my lecturer.
To view this, see the "Example Inputs" file.
